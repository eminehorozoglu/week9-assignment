Reflections:

1- After signing up with clerk, it took me a while to find the page I wanted to assign.

2-Normally, I created the database files after making a plan. But in this project, I created the sql tables step by step. After creating the sql table, I created the java codes. I proceeded step by step by doing this for each page.#

3-I couldn't create a wireframe because I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to show on the sql tables and page. The pages formed in my head as I created them.

4-I had difficulty creating queries for the sql tables and connecting them to each other.

5-I tried to make a form with radix, but it was difficult for me and made the simple menu with radix.

6-I used a motion effect for the home page.

7-I didn't use many styles because I didn't have enough time. I just used tailwind.

8-If I had time, I would have added comments to the posts, but I couldn't because I ran out of time.
